## üì¶Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install **Python3.10** or higher.

After installing Python, you will need to set up a **Virtual Environment** on your operating system:


### Configuring CMD

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Install the Virtual Environment (virtualenv):
```
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```
env\Scripts\Activate.bat
```

Install the project dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Environment Variables

To run the bot correctly, you need to configure some environment variables to ensure proper communication with Telegram. To access the values, look for the file ``` config.py ```.

Read the tables below to find the values to be filled in:

#### Telegram Settings

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                           |
| :---------- | :--------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `TELEFONE` | `string` | Phone number with country code (DDI) |
| `API_ID` | `int` | Telegram API key |
| `API_HASH` | `string` | Telegram API hash |
| `CHAT_ID` | `int` | Channel ID for sending messages |

#### Bot Settings

| Parameter   | Type       | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `TAXA_DE_SINAL` | `float` | Signal sending percentage. **(0.0 - 1.0)** |

## üë£ How to Use

First, create a channel that will serve as the communication and signal delivery medium on Telegram.

### Getting the Channel Code
Before running the bot, you need to obtain the channel code (chat ID) from Telegram. With the virtual environment active, execute the following command to list all active chats in Telegram:

```
python3 main.py "listChat"
```

## First Time Setup
When you run the project for the **first time**  in the terminal, you'll need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1:
- Enter your Telegram phone number in the format: ``` +55 99 90000-0000 ```
- Note: This must match the number in the ```config.py``` file.

#### Step 2:
- Enter the confirmation code sent to you via Telegram in the terminal.

Once you execute the command to list the active chats in Telegram, you will receive a list of chat names and their corresponding IDs:

#### Example:
```
Name: Jhon Doe
ID: 987654

Name: Signal Channel
ID: -123456

Name: chat4
ID: 654987
```
Copy the chat ID that will be used and insert it into the **```TELEFONE```** parameter found in the ``` config.py ``` (**‚öôÔ∏è Configuration of Variables** ).

# üöÄ Finally
Run the bot using the appropriate command for your environment. Wait for real-time signal notifications to arrive directly in your Telegram chat!

```
python3 main.py
```
